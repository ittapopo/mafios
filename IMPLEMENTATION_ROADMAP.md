# Implementation Roadmap - From Prototype to Playable Game

**Strategic plan for implementing all placeholder features and making the game functional**

---

## Current State Assessment

### What Works ‚úÖ
- Responsive layout (mobile to desktop)
- Nordic theme and visual design
- Navigation and routing
- Crime timer functionality (UI only)
- Territory selection (UI only)
- Component architecture

### What Doesn't Work ‚ùå
- 6 routes incomplete (/defense + 5 social features)
- 10+ buttons without handlers
- All data is hardcoded in components (not using services)
- No game state management
- No persistence
- No actual game mechanics (rewards, progression, etc.)
- Stats never update

---

## Priority Categories

### üî¥ **P0 - Critical (MVP Blockers)**
Features absolutely required for a minimal playable experience

### üü† **P1 - High Priority**
Core gameplay features that make the game engaging

### üü° **P2 - Medium Priority**
Enhancement features that improve the experience

### üü¢ **P3 - Low Priority**
Nice-to-have features for future releases

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Connect existing UI to data layer, enable basic state management

### üî¥ P0 - Critical

#### 1.1 Global Game State
**Problem:** No centralized state management
**Solution:** Implement React Context or Zustand for game state

```typescript
// app/lib/contexts/GameContext.tsx
interface GameState {
  player: {
    name: string;
    kontanter: number;    // Cash
    inflytande: number;   // Influence
    respekt: number;      // Respect
    polisbevakning: number; // Heat
  };
  chapter: {
    name: string;
    members: FamilyMember[];
    territories: Territory[];
  };
  operations: Operation[];
  equipment: EquipmentItemType[];
}
```

**Files to create:**
- `app/lib/contexts/GameContext.tsx`
- `app/lib/hooks/useGameState.ts`

**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Dependencies:** None
**Impact:** High - enables all other features

---

#### 1.2 Connect Components to Services
**Problem:** Components have hardcoded data instead of using services
**Solution:** Replace hardcoded arrays with service calls

**Priority files to update:**
1. **CharacterProfile** ‚Üí Use `CharacterService.getEquipment()`
2. **MaterialStatus** ‚Üí Use `CharacterService.getMaterials()`
3. **BusinessContent** ‚Üí Use `BusinessService.getCrimeTiers()`
4. **FamilyMembers** ‚Üí Use service (to be created)
5. **SecurityStatus** ‚Üí Use service (to be created)
6. **TerritoryContent** ‚Üí Use service (to be created)

**Example refactor:**
```typescript
// Before (hardcoded):
const equipment = [
  { slot: 'Weapon', label: 'CZ Scorpion', ... }
];

// After (service-based):
import { CharacterService } from '@/app/lib/data/services';
const equipment = CharacterService.getEquipment();
```

**Effort:** 3-4 days
**Dependencies:** Services exist, just need to wire up
**Impact:** High - removes code duplication, enables data updates

---

#### 1.3 Implement LocalStorage Persistence

## Conclusion

The roadmap prioritizes getting to a **playable MVP in 4 weeks** by focusing on:
1. **Foundation** (state, services, persistence)
2. **Core gameplay** (crimes, territories, family)
3. **Essential routes** (defense)

Social features, polish, and advanced mechanics can be added incrementally after the MVP is functional.

**Start with Phase 1, complete MVP before adding nice-to-haves.**
