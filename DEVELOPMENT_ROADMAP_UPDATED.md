## üóÑÔ∏è Phase 4: Database Integration (AFTER Phase 3)
**Goal:** Replace localStorage with PostgreSQL for production

### 4.1 Database Schema Design
**Effort:** 2-3 days

**Tables to create:**
- `users` - Player authentication
- `players` - Player game state
- `equipment_inventory` - Owned equipment
- `territories` - Territory ownership and control
- `operations` - Active operations
- `businesses` - Owned businesses
- `family_members` - Chapter members
- `missions` - Mission progress
- `events` - Triggered events
- `skills` - Unlocked skills
- `rival_gangs` - Gang relationships
- `game_sessions` - Save states

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Design schema based on completed TypeScript interfaces
2. Create Prisma schema
3. Set up database migrations
4. Create API routes for CRUD operations
5. Replace GameContext localStorage with API calls
6. Add loading states and error handling
7. Implement save slots system

---

### 4.2 Authentication & User Accounts
**Effort:** 3-4 days

**Features:**
- NextAuth integration (already configured)
- User registration/login
- Multiple save slots per user
- Cloud save synchronization
- Session management

---

### 4.3 API Layer
**Effort:** 4-5 days

**Create API routes:**
- `/api/player/*` - Player CRUD
- `/api/equipment/*` - Equipment management
- `/api/territories/*` - Territory operations
- `/api/operations/*` - Operations management
- `/api/businesses/*` - Business operations
- `/api/missions/*` - Mission progress
- `/api/save/*` - Save/load game state

---

## üé® Phase 5: Polish & Enhancement
**Goal:** Improve UX and add social features

### 5.1 Achievements System
- 50+ achievements
- Badge collection
- Stat tracking

### 5.2 Leaderboards
- Global rankings
- Chapter comparisons
- Weekly competitions

### 5.3 Social Features (Low Priority)
- Messages (already routed)
- Notifications
- Alliances with other players

### 5.4 Visual Enhancements
- Animations and transitions
- Sound effects
- Music tracks
- Loading screens

---

## üìã Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Phase 3)
1. **Business Management** (3-4 days) - Adds strategic income layer
2. **Rival Gangs** (4-5 days) - Adds conflict and challenge
3. **Events System** (3-4 days) - Makes game feel alive
4. **Missions** (5-6 days) - Adds structure and goals
5. **Skills** (2-3 days) - Adds character progression

**Total Phase 3 Estimate:** 17-22 days

### Then: Database Integration (Phase 4)
- At this point, all entities will be complete
- Database schema will map 1:1 to TypeScript interfaces
- Much easier to design comprehensive database structure
- Can migrate localStorage data to database

---

## üéØ Why This Order?

1. **Complete game mechanics first** - Know exactly what data needs persistence
2. **Avoid database refactoring** - Design schema once when all entities are known
3. **Rapid prototyping** - localStorage allows fast iteration
4. **Better database design** - Full understanding of relationships and access patterns
5. **Test gameplay balance** - Easier to tweak numbers without database migrations
